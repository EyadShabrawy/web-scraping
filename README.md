# Web Scraping Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Web Scraping Repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files, each designed to scrape different websites. The scripts are written in Python and utilize various web scraping libraries and tools. My goal is to provide a useful resource for those looking to learn about web scraping techniques or gather data from a range of online sources.

## Repository Structure

Each `.ipynb` file in the repository is named according to the website it is designed to scrape. Here's a brief overview:

- `Elmenus_Scraping.ipynb`: Script for scraping Elmenus website.
- `IMDP.ipynb`: Script for scraping IMDP website.
- `Pokemon.ipynb`: Script for scraping Pokemon website.
- `Departments_Scraping.ipynb`: Script for scraping departments from york.ac.uk website.
- `Institute_Cleaning.ipynb`: Script for cleaning institutes.

## Features
